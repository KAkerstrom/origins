LocalView object idea:
 - Create a 2D array of ints that represent the "weight" of that decision
 - Lower weights for diagonals, water, predators, etc.
 - Water is decreased less the more thirsty the dorf is, and other such shenanigans



 ///////////////////////////////
 Things I wish I could've added:
	 I ended up taking out Dorf evolution, which was suposed to be the major focus of the game, so I would like to add that again
	 Hit on keydown, not keyup
	 Have variables for when a dorf needs to worry about a stat (thirst = 70, for example)
	 Give dorfs MaxHealth etc stats
	 Fix predator animation (hurt/attacking while moving)
	 Better Tutorial
	 Stamina & Sleeping
	 Better Saving/loading
	 Different-looking Dorfs - even just a recolor.
	 More interesting Dorf stats, to make Dorf breeding more important.
	 Items - Both permanent items to give stat boosts, and items that a Dorf can hold for a temporary boost. Also various other items. (would actually be pretty simple to add)
	 Better pathfinding - Something like A* perhaps? Something better than "move here, or if you can't, just move randomly".
	 Better Dorf AI - Things like personality, better reactions to predators / players, more nuanced than "if hunger is >X, eat".
	 Multiplayer
	 Better tutorial - Perhaps during gameplay
	 Controller support
	 More "objects" - walls, doors, machines, etc
	 There are several stats and such in the code that are unused, such as Dorf strength
	 Make the LocalView class a bit more efficient for scanning Tiles
	 Change Player code to an FSM
	 Put everything in one list & use LINQ to get sub-lists
	 Organize code better & refactor some things

 Tutorial Planning:

-Controls:
Arrow Keys - Change Direction / Move
Z - Create land
X - Dig
C - Hit
S - Grab
I - Inspect Dorf
P - Pause Game
Shift - Focus Reticle on Player
Ctrl - View Dorf stats
Mouse Wheel - Zoom In / Out
 
-Player:
	The Player is the little dude in the center of the screen.
	He cannot die or be hurt, but instead acts as a sort of cursor or conduit for you to interact with the world.
	There is a yellow square by the player. This is your "Reticle". Your actions (hitting, grabbing, etc) will be performed on whatever is on the Reticle.
	You can move your Player / reticle with the arrow keys. A quick tap will move the Reticle without moving the Player.

 -Dorfs:
	The Dorfs are the little blue guys walking around.
	The Dorfs are the main focus of the game. In theory, your goal is to take care of them and let them prosper.
	Dorfs will occassionally lay eggs, which will create a new Dorf with stats similar to its parent.
	Dorfs have four important stats, which you can check at a glance by holding Ctrl.
	(Holding Ctrl will also display the Dorf's name and current action)

	Health (red):
	 The Dorf's health. If this reaches 0, the Dorf will die.
	 Health can be reduced by things such as being hit, or being deprived of food or water too long.
	 Health can be gained somewhat by eating red flowers.
	Stamina (green):
	 The "energy" the Dorf has. If this falls too low, the Dorf will fall asleep.
	 Stamina is reduced by actions, such as walking or swimming.
	 Stamina can be gained somewhat by eating green flowers.
	Hunger (orange):
	 The hunger of the Dorf. Unlike Health and Stamina, this should be kept low.
	 Hunger is increased at a slow rate over time.
	 Hunger can be reduced by eating any flower, though blue flowers are best.
	Thirst (blue):
	 The thirst of the Dorf. Like Hunger, this should be kept low for a healthy, happy Dorf.
	 Thirst is increased over time.
	 Thirst can be reduced by swimming, so ensure your Dorfs have ample access to water.

 -Predators:
	Predators are the bad guys. They will harrass and kill your Dorfs on-sight.
	If you see a Predator, your best option is to smack 'em around before they do any damage.

 -Trees / Stumps:
	Trees can be destroyed by hitting them, which will yield a Stump
	Stumps can be grabbed and moved, and will act as a solid wall.

 -Dirt:
	The player can dig with X, turning Grass into Dirt.
	The Player, and other characters, will move faster on Dirt than on Grass.
	If Dirt is created next to Water, the Water will flow to fill in the Dirt.

 -Flowers
	Flowers are the colorful things that Dorfs eat.
	As described under "Dorfs", different coloured flowers will have different effects:
	Red: Health
	Green: Stamina
	Blue: (extra) Hunger
	Grabbing a flower, and placing it on another flower, will combine the colours, allowing for simple flower "breeding".
