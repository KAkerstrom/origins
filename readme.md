<h1>Origins</h1>
<p>This is a game I made as a final project in one of my college classes.</p>
<p>This is the most "complete" of my non-work projects, although there's still a lot I would like to add.</p>
<p>The game includes simple instructions on how to play (under "Tutorial").</p>
<p>Noteably, you can pick various things up and move them around, punch things, and dig water channels.</p>
<p>All the code, drawn art (excluding sprites), music, and sound effects were made by me.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
